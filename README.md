## Creating a click counter

I created a click counter which is consists of a button and a text element that shows the numbers. When the user presses the button the number increases. The code uses state management, where the current number is stored in the state.

To run the code in the browser, I used the **npm start** command.

After running the code locally, I got the following output:
